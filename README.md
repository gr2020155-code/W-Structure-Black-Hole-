**The Single Law**  
The Universe is a **self-consistent informational structure**, in which **only those states and evolutions are possible and stable** that **do not generate contradictions** — neither locally nor globally (PAN condition).  

Ontological basis (zero level):  
- Everything begins with pure information.  
- No axioms, assumptions, or continuity.  
- Everything observed (space, time, mass, particles, gravity, black holes) is a **projection** of the zero level and its consequences.

A black hole is the **limit of projection**, where the 1st level (space-time-mass) fully collapses, leaving only the pure zero level: W-class (maximum definiteness, zero variability).  
W-Structure resolves **all 7 classical black hole paradoxes** without a single axiom.

### 1. Seven paradoxes of classical physics that disappear
- Singularity (infinite density at zero)  
- Information loss (Hawking paradox)  
- Firewall at the horizon  
- Complementarity of two observers  
- Contradictions of the event horizon  
- Growth paradox of black holes  
- Inconsistency between GR and quantum mechanics  

### 2. Basis of W-Structure: informational cells
All space consists of discrete informational cells.  
Each cell:  
- carries a fixed amount of information  
- can change configuration  
- has two limiting classes: **0** and **W**

**0** — minimum information, maximum variants.  
**W** — maximum information, zero variants.  

0 and W are **antitwins**: opposite in description, identical in meaning at the limit.

### 3. Time and space — projections, not fundamental
- Time is the metric of configuration change in cells.  
  No change → time **does not exist**.  
- Space is the projection of cell distinguishability.  
  No position choice → space **does not exist**.

### 4. How a black hole arises
With increasing density/mass:  
→ cells saturate with information  
→ exchange between them is blocked  
→ variability → 0  
→ region transitions to **W-class**

This is **not collapse**, but **maximum complexity configuration**:  
- variability = 0  
- time = absent  
- space = absent  
- contradiction = 0 (PAN fulfilled)

### 5. Maximum and zero — the same thing
Inside a black hole:  
**Maximum** — information fully packed, all connections used.  
**Zero** — no choice, no dynamics.  

Physical realization of the 0 ↔ W antitwin.

### 6. Event horizon — projection, not boundary
- At the horizon variability still exists → ringdown, exchange.  
- Beyond the horizon — W-class: variability = 0 → no trajectories, no "falling in".  

"Falling into a black hole" — illusion of an external observer.  
Ontologically, a black hole **begins immediately**.

### 7. Mass and Hawking radiation
- Mass inside **is undefined** (no dynamics, no response).  
  Observed mass — **boundary projection** on the horizon.  
- Hawking radiation **impossible a priori** — no dynamics for "leakage".  
  This is a projection of the horizon onto the outer layer, where information is **redistributed** in the seam invariant **K_w = \pi^2**.

### 8. Why exactly \pi^2?
K_w = \pi^2 — condition for contradiction-free geometric closure:  
- 1D → S^1 → 2\pi  
- 2D → S^2 → 4\pi  
- quadratic informational measure → \pi^2

### 9. "Growth" of black holes: one trajectory of variability
"Growth" is an incorrect term. This is **boundary reconfiguration** (horizon).  
Inside — variability = 0, no space/time.  
On the horizon remains **exactly one permissible trajectory of variability**:  
- 0 trajectories → growth impossible  
- ≥2 → contradiction (PAN violated)  
- 1 — the only non-contradictory option  

New information is **repacked on the horizon** along this trajectory → horizon area increases, entropy ∼ area, ringdown — one-dimensional process.  

The "growth in 2D space" paradox disappears: horizon is 2D projection, trajectory is 1D line of variability, **inside** there is no space for growth.

### 10. Conclusion
A black hole is **not an object in space**.  
It is the **ontological limit of variability**, where space, time, and mass lose meaning as projections.

W-Structure resolves **all 7 paradoxes** of black holes without axioms.  
A black hole is **proof** that the Universe is structured **informationally**, not geometrically.

**A black hole is not the end of physics.  
A black hole is its beginning.**
